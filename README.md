# How to use this code:
1. Launch MATLAB and change directory to the code/ subdirectory of this project
2. Never change directories within MATLAB. All paths are relative to the code directory, so our code won't work if you change working directory

# To generate the results in the article, from the matlab prompt:

>> run % runs the parameter estimation, looping thru all indications

>> post_process % generates article figures: 6,7,3a,3b,4c,5a (see titles and/or figure names)

>> analyze_paradox % generates article figures: 1,4a,4b,5,and graphical abstract left figure

>> make_results_table  % generates article figure 2 and table 1
